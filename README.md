# SPACE INVADERS

This is a recreation of the classic space invaders video game. Loosly based on the AtariST version by
Robert HC Leong(1990)

Implemented in the C programming language, using SDL library to display graphics on the screen.

To compile you need to have SDL installed on your system and the header files
available to you operating systems PATH environment variable

`gcc si.c -lSDL -o invaders`

note that there is no sound added so far. the goal was to create a working complete version of the gameplay only
